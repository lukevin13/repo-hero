# Repo-Hero
Gets repositories of a specified user. Written as a coding assessment with styling not being a
main requirement.

## Usage
### User Search
Enter a username into the form to get that user's available repositories. If that user does not
exist, an alert with pop up to let you know.

### Pagination
A maximum of 30 repos per page can be viewed in the table. If the user has more than 30
repositories, navigation buttons will become availabe for you to navigate pages.
- '<<': first page
- '<': previous page
- '>': next page
- '>>': last page

### Moving Forward
- The navigation buttons are not in order. I didn't think it was too big an issue as this
  is just a quick assessment
- Could add manual page number input for manual page navigation
- Could also display current page
- Getting repos by organization or getting ALL public available repositories can be added for
  additional functionality
- Obviously styling is an area that can be improved upon
